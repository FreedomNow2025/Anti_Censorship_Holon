US Censorship Industrial Complex: (Current or historic or side factors):
* Videos (Must Watch)

* [List of Organizations](https://github.com/FreedomNow2025/Anti_Censorship_Holon/blob/main/Files/Organizations.md)

Censorship via Whole-of-Society means:
* Democracy is removed. Citizens lose control. Dictator control by Wash DC bureaucrats.
* Free thought removed. MSM News turned into propoganda under control of DC dictators
* Stealing US tax dollars to have dictator control
* Funneling money to tech tools to enable DC dictator control
* Carrot/Stick forcing social media companies under DC dictator control. GAB threatened to be destroyed by EU laws.
* X.com worked on being killed by all advertising turned off (when Elon purchased it). DC Dictators had US intel control to get 99% of US Fortune 1000 companies to turn OFF their advertising IMMEDIATELY (all at one time).
* Twitter v1.0 with Jack Dorsey. He had a gun put to his head to have gov censorship go from 0mph to 100 mph. The gun to his head? It was when he was told he would be blocked from having his Twitter iPhone app blocked from Apple's app store.  This is what BROKE Jack Dorsey.
* GAB. He had a gun put to his head to have gov censorship go from 0mph to 100 mph. The gun to his head? It was when he was told he would be blocked from having his GAB iPhone app blocked from Apple's app store.  CEO of GAP wouldn't capitulate, so the bullet was fired. He is blocked from Apple and Google/Android app stores.
* Parlor.  CEO had a gun put to his head to have gov censorship go from 0mph to 100 mph. The gun to his head? It was when he was told he would be blocked from having his Parlor iPhone app blocked from Apple's app store.  This is what BROKE Parlor. He had to "allow" leftist external services "moderate" (censor) the citizen posts in Parlor.  Capitulating allowed Parlor to stay in the app store. Parlor became useless for Republican citizens to communicate. Parlor effect.
* Reddit: They have been 100 mph censoring republicans on there for possibly 20 YEARS. GAB, Parlor and many others exist because Republicans and Libertarians have been gaslight censored, hard censored, banned, etc on Reddit. Sub-reddit by sub-reddit moved to grow Parlor, Gab and about 15 more in the long-tail of reddit/twitter small competitors.
* Facebook has "Civiv" the AI censorship / moderation.  It may fully censor, or gaslight censor (~90% censor) or cause other impact. In my opinion, 2015-2019 had Democrat posts go wide-and-far but Republican posts appeared to not get the same reach.
* There is a story that in 2019, the following happened with Facebook censorship & the CEO Zuck. Zuck was upset about how much censorship against republicans was happenin in FB by 2019.  He wanted to stop it. He made a public announcement alluding to it. He had internal plans. The power elite behind cenorship lined up the massive block of Forturne 1000 advertisers.  It would have been an $800 Billion/year OFF SWITCH to ad revenue.  That was their gun to the head of Zuck in 2019 to STOP his plans at that time to remove FB censorship against Republicans.
 * Amazon and AWS. This is where servers run for Twitter / Gab and the others. This is another gun to the head of social media. Gab is the best illustration. They wouldn't roll out leftist censorship (which they were demanded to do).  Amazon AWS banned them from using servers. Parlor also on 1/10/2021.  Parlor was offline for weeks because AWS was pulled out from under them. Truth Social fled AWS servers Feb 2022.
* Censored by credit card companies. Gab lost Stripe credit card processing in 2018/2019.  Stripe turned OFF credit card processing for Parlor Jan-10-2021. Truth Social didn't use Stripe because they thought this problem would happen to them.
* PayPal for Credit Card processing by social media companies.  Gab lost paypal in October 2018. Gab in Jan 2021.
* Debanked. GAB CEO talked about being "banned by banks" in 2019. 
* Marc Andreesson on the Joe Rogan went into depth on how the gov "Operation Chock Point 2.0" politically targeted Republicans.  Startups (like social media companies) debanked because they were Republican. A gov operation with a code name. Scaling the number of people debanked (aka China Credit dictator punishments on USA soil)
* The political left had "Content moderation external services". These were censorship against Republican posts that were too annoying to democrats. At one point, I believe I heard an interview that Parlor was told they must use this or lose being in the Apple AppStore. Parlor capitulated (from my understanding). Their users had to endure this censorship (or whatever the impact was), but it was probably the only way for Parlor to stay in the Apple app store.

All were often coordinated to have punishments happen in the same month. Debanked. Credit card processing turned off. Advertising turned OFF. Apple & Android both were at risk of losing app store at the same time. This is because of the powerful elite with extreme power to coordinate dictator control forcing censorship.  Mass coordination. Getting a large percentage of USA Fortune 1,000 companies to turn off their advertising at the same time requires USA Intel service kinds off power and coordination.
