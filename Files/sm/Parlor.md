# Parlor

Related to Censorship or Propoganda or anything potentially interesting in the topic of US Cenorship Industrial Complex.


* Amazon and AWS. This is where servers run for Parlor / Gab and the others. This is another gun to the head of social media. Gab is the best illustration. They wouldn't roll out leftist censorship (which they were demanded to do).  Amazon AWS banned them from using servers. Parlor also on 1/10/2021.  Parlor was offline for weeks because AWS was pulled out from under them. Truth Social fled AWS servers Feb 2022.
* Parlor.  CEO had a gun put to his head to have gov censorship go from 0mph to 100 mph. The gun to his head? It was when he was told he would be blocked from having his Parlor iPhone app blocked from Apple's app store.  This is what BROKE Parlor. He had to "allow" leftist external services "moderate" (censor) the citizen posts in Parlor.  Capitulating allowed Parlor to stay in the app store. Parlor became useless for Republican citizens to communicate. Parlor effect.
* Censored by credit card companies. Gab lost Stripe credit card processing in 2018/2019.  Stripe turned OFF credit card processing for Parlor Jan-10-2021. Truth Social didn't use Stripe because they thought this problem would happen to them.
* The political left had "Content moderation external services". These were censorship against Republican posts that were too annoying to democrats. At one point, I believe I heard an interview that Parlor was told they must use this or lose being in the Apple AppStore. Parlor capitulated (from my understanding). Their users had to endure this censorship (or whatever the impact was), but it was probably the only way for Parlor to stay in the Apple app store.
