The following came from Grok:
Question: Explain GARM with respect to US censorship or claims of it.
ANSWER:

## Key Points
- Research suggests NSF's Track F funding supported tools to combat misinformation, with claims it could enable censorship.
- It seems likely organizations like universities pursued this funding for AI tools, sparking controversy over free speech.
- The evidence leans toward these tools being used to shape public opinion, raising ethical concerns.

### Background
The National Science Foundation (NSF), a U.S. federal agency, launched the Convergence Accelerator program to address societal challenges through research. Track F, "Trust & Authenticity in Communication Systems," focused on developing technologies to counter misinformation online, particularly related to COVID-19 and the 2020 election.

### Funding and Projects
From 2021 to 2024, NSF awarded about $39 million under Track F to organizations like universities and non-profits. Projects included AI tools like ARTT for managing discussions and Co-Insights for scanning social media, aiming to enhance trust in communication systems.

### Controversy and Claims
Critics argue these tools could censor legitimate speech, with ties to initiatives like the Election Integrity Partnership raising concerns. The NSF faced scrutiny, especially after reports of tools going missing post-2025 election, suggesting policy shifts.

## Comprehensive Analysis of NSF Track F Funding and Censorship Claims

This detailed analysis explores the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Track F funding under the Convergence Accelerator program, focusing on its role in developing tools to combat misinformation and the associated claims of enabling U.S. censorship. The discussion covers funding details, project specifics, controversies, and recent developments, providing a thorough understanding for researchers, policymakers, and the public.

### Introduction to NSF and the Convergence Accelerator
The NSF, established to advance scientific research, initiated the Convergence Accelerator to tackle complex societal issues through interdisciplinary efforts. Track F, titled "Trust & Authenticity in Communication Systems," was launched to enhance trust in online communication by developing technologies to detect and counter misinformation and disinformation. This track was particularly active from 2021 to 2024, aligning with heightened concerns over misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election.

### Funding Details and Organizational Pursuits
Between 2021 and 2024, the NSF allocated approximately $39 million to Track F, funding various projects led by universities and non-profit organizations. These entities pursued funding to develop AI-powered tools aimed at identifying and mitigating misinformation, often in collaboration with media and tech sectors. The funding was part of a broader initiative to address societal challenges, but its focus on communication systems drew significant attention.

The following table lists key projects funded under Track F, their funding amounts, and brief descriptions:

| Project Name          | Funding Amount (USD) | Funding Years | Status              | Description/Notes                                                                 |

These projects were designed to provide tools for governments, media, and tech companies to manage online discourse, with a focus on enhancing trust and countering what was deemed harmful misinformation.

### Claims of Censorship and Ethical Concerns
The funding of Track F projects has sparked significant controversy, with critics alleging that the NSF is enabling censorship under the guise of combating misinformation. Key concerns include:

- **Subjectivity of Misinformation**: The tools developed under Track F aim to identify and counter misinformation, but the definition of misinformation can be subjective. Critics argue that these tools could be used to suppress legitimate speech or viewpoints that challenge mainstream narratives, potentially infringing on free speech rights.
  
- **Government Involvement in Speech**: The involvement of a federal agency like the NSF in funding such tools raises concerns about government overreach into private speech and online discourse. Reports suggest that these tools could be used by governments and Big Tech to shape public opinion by restricting certain viewpoints or promoting others, effectively functioning as propaganda tools ([House Judiciary Committee Report](https://judiciary.house.gov/media/press-releases/new-report-details-how-national-science-foundation-funding-ai-tools-censor-and)).

- **Ties to Controversial Initiatives**: Several projects, such as WiseDex, have been linked to organizations involved in other censorship efforts, like the Election Integrity Partnership, which has been accused of collaborating with tech companies to suppress certain types of content. This has led to claims that NSF funding is indirectly supporting censorship efforts ([The Federalist Article](https://thefederalist.com/2025/04/02/after-trumps-election-several-nsf-funded-censorship-tools-go-missing/)).

- **Public Scrutiny and Cover-Up**: The House Judiciary Committee released a report on February 6, 2024, detailing how the NSF funded AI-powered censorship tools and attempted to cover up its actions by tracking public criticism and developing media strategies, including considering blacklisting certain American media outlets scrutinizing its funding ([House Judiciary Committee Report](https://judiciary.house.gov/media/press-releases/new-report-details-how-national-science-foundation-funding-ai-tools-censor-and)).

### Recent Developments and Policy Shifts
Following the election of President Trump in November 2024, there were reports that several NSF-funded censorship tools under Track F either went missing or were no longer active by early 2025. This suggests a potential shift in policy or funding priorities under the new administration, with the NSF facing increased scrutiny. For instance, on April 2, 2025, The Federalist reported that several tools, such as WiseDex, were no longer operational, raising questions about their future ([The Federalist Article](https://thefederalist.com/2025/04/02/after-trumps-election-several-nsf-funded-censorship-tools-go-missing/)).

Additionally, the NSF has been under congressional investigation, with the Commerce Committee identifying over 105 grants between 2021 and 2023, totaling over $66 million, for so-called "misinformation" research, directly funding organizations that work with online platforms to censor Americans ([Sen. Cruz Demands Answers](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2023/10/sen-cruz-demands-answers-on-taxpayer-funded-censorship)). This scrutiny has highlighted the tension between the NSF's mission and concerns over censorship.

### Conclusion
The NSF's Track F funding under the Convergence Accelerator program supported the development of tools to combat misinformation, pursued by organizations like universities and non-profits. However, the initiative has been criticized for potentially enabling censorship, raising ethical and political concerns about free speech and government involvement in online discourse. Recent developments, including policy shifts post-2025 election, suggest ongoing debates about the balance between protecting public discourse and preserving individual rights.

This analysis underscores the complexity of funding research with societal implications, highlighting the need for transparent oversight and public dialogue to ensure alignment with democratic values.
