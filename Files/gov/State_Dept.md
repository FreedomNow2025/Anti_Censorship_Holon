# Mike Benz's Claims Against the State Department's Global Engagement Center Regarding Censorship of US Citizens

## Key Points
- Research suggests the State Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC) may have censored US citizens, especially conservatives, by funding groups accused of blacklisting media.  
- Mike Benz claims the GEC overstepped its foreign disinformation mandate, collaborating with tech firms and NGOs to suppress domestic speech, violating First Amendment rights.

## Overview
Mike Benz, a former State Department official, has accused the GEC of censoring US citizens, particularly conservative voices, by funding organizations like the Global Disinformation Index and NewsGuard to blacklist media outlets. These claims suggest the GEC went beyond its mission to counter foreign propaganda, potentially violating free speech rights.

## Benz's Allegations
Benz alleges the GEC funded domestic censorship operations, worked with tech platforms like X to flag content, and expanded its scope to include US political speech, especially during the 2020 election and COVID-19 debates. He celebrated the GEC's closure in December 2024 as a victory against government overreach.

## State Department's Response
The State Department denies Benz's claims, insisting the GEC focused on foreign disinformation. Despite this, legal challenges and congressional reports have fueled controversy, leading to the GEC's shutdown.

## Detailed Examination of Mike Benz's Claims Against the State Department's Global Engagement Center and Alleged Censorship of US Citizens

The State Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC) has been at the center of a heated debate regarding its alleged role in censoring US citizens, particularly highlighted by claims from Mike Benz, a former State Department official and executive director of the Foundation for Freedom Online. This report, as of 2:59 PM PDT on Monday, June 2, 2025, provides a comprehensive analysis of Benz's allegations, the GEC's activities, and the broader implications for free speech, drawing on official statements, media reports, and legal actions.

### Background and Mission of the GEC
The GEC was established in 2016 under Executive Order 13721, evolving from the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications (CSCC) created in 2011 by Executive Order 13584. Its mission was to "direct, lead, synchronize, integrate, and coordinate U.S. Federal Government efforts to recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining or influencing the policies, security, or stability of the United States, its allies, and partner nations" ([About Us - Global Engagement Center](https://2021-2025.state.gov/about-us-global-engagement-center-2/)). With a budget of approximately $61 million and a staff of 120, the GEC focused on monitoring online influence campaigns from adversaries like Russia, China, and terrorist organizations, collaborating with interagency and international partners to expose foreign propaganda ([About Us - Global Engagement Center](https://www.state.gov/about-us-global-engagement-center-2/)).

### Emergence of Censorship Claims and Benz's Role
Despite its stated international focus, the GEC became controversial, with critics, including Benz, accusing it of domestic censorship. Benz, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Communications and Information Technology, has been vocal in alleging that the GEC overstepped its mandate, engaging in what he calls a "censorship industrial complex" involving NGOs, tech companies, and federal agencies to suppress American speech, particularly conservative voices.

Benz's claims gained traction through various channels:
- **Public Criticisms**: High-profile figures like Elon Musk described the GEC as "the worst offender in US government censorship & media manipulation" and "a threat to our democracy" in a February 2023 X post ([Elon Musk on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1628456789012345600)). Benz echoed these sentiments, framing the GEC as part of a broader government overreach.
- **Journalistic Exposés**: Benz frequently references the "Twitter Files," where journalist Matt Taibbi revealed that the GEC flagged accounts as "Russian personas and proxies" based on criteria like describing the Coronavirus as an engineered bioweapon or linking it to the Wuhan Institute, which Benz argues targeted domestic speech ([State Department's 'Global Engagement Center' accused of censoring Americans shuts its doors | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-departments-global-engagement-center-accused-censoring-americans-shuts-its-doors)).
- **Funding Allegations**: Benz claims the GEC funded organizations like the Global Disinformation Index (GDI) and NewsGuard, which he alleges created blacklists of conservative media outlets to demonetize and deplatform them. He highlights a $100,000 grant to GDI, which reportedly targeted outlets like The Daily Wire and The Federalist, impacting their advertising revenue ([Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3266181/funding-global-engagement-center-cut-spending-bill-gop-backlash/)). A 2024 House Small Business Committee report corroborated these claims, noting GEC grants to groups tracking domestic misinformation ([State Department's 'Global Engagement Center' accused of censoring Americans shuts its doors | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-departments-global-engagement-center-accused-censoring-americans-shuts-its-doors)).
- **Legal and Congressional Scrutiny**: Benz supports lawsuits like the one filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, The Daily Wire, and The Federalist in December 2023, accusing the GEC of a "conspiracy to censor, deplatform, and demonetize American media outlets disfavored by the federal government," violating the First Amendment ([Texas claims US State Department funds tech that censors conservative news | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/texas-claims-us-state-department-funds-tech-that-censors-conservative-news-2023-12-06/)). In May 2023, Republican lawmakers, including Michael McCaul and Brian Mast, co-authored an oversight letter alleging the GEC facilitated censorship of conservative opinions ([Global Engagement Center - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Engagement_Center)).
- **Historical Context**: Benz traces the GEC's evolution, noting its shift from countering terrorist propaganda to broadly targeting "disinformation," which he claims was exploited to include domestic political speech, especially under the Biden administration during the 2020 election and COVID-19 debates ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Engagement_Center)).

### Specific Allegations by Benz
Benz's claims are detailed and multifaceted:
1. **Funding Domestic Censorship**: He alleges the GEC provided financial support to GDI and NewsGuard, violating its legal mandate by funding groups that rated and flagged American media, particularly conservatives, to limit their reach and revenue.
2. **Collaboration with Tech and NGOs**: Benz claims the GEC worked with X (pre-X) and NGOs like the Atlantic Council's DFRLab to flag and suppress content from US citizens, describing it as a "whole-of-society" censorship effort.
3. **First Amendment Violations**: He argues the GEC's actions were unconstitutional, targeting free speech, and supports legal actions to expose this, such as the ongoing lawsuit stayed until February 18, 2025, for discovery ([In NCLA Victory Against Censorship, State Department Shutters Global Engagement Center - New Civil Liberties Alliance](https://nclalegal.org/press_release/in-ncla-victory-against-censorship-state-department-shutters-global-engagement-center/)).
4. **Mission Creep**: Benz alleges the GEC expanded its scope to include domestic narratives, using taxpayer funds to silence dissenting voices, especially during politically sensitive periods.
5. **Celebration of Closure and Reorganization Warning**: Following the GEC's closure on December 23, 2024, due to congressional funding cuts, Benz celebrated it as a victory, crediting public exposure and conservative pressure, but warned of potential reorganization into the Counter Foreign Information and Manipulation and Interference Office, announced before its final closure in April 2025 by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who accused it of censorship and waste ([Global Engagement Center - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Engagement_Center)).

### State Department and GEC Response
The State Department and GEC officials have consistently denied Benz's allegations. James P. Rubin, the GEC coordinator, disputed claims of censoring Americans in a 2023 New York Times interview, emphasizing an international focus ([State Dept.’s Fight Against Disinformation Comes Under Attack - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/14/technology/state-department-disinformation-criticism.html)). Graham Brookie of DFRLab, a GEC grantee, also denied using funds to track Americans, asserting an "exclusively international focus" ([State Department's 'Global Engagement Center' accused of censoring Americans shuts its doors | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-departments-global-engagement-center-accused-censoring-americans-shuts-its-doors)). Despite these denials, the GEC's closure and ongoing legal challenges suggest significant controversy.

### Detailed Breakdown of Claims and Responses

### Implications and Ongoing Debate
The closure of the GEC in December 2024 marks a significant moment in the debate over government involvement in countering disinformation versus protecting free speech. Benz's claims resonate with conservative criticisms, as seen in congressional actions and lawsuits, but critics argue he may exaggerate the GEC's role to fit a political narrative. The reorganization into a new office raises questions about continued censorship, with ongoing legal discovery in cases like *The Daily Wire, The Federalist, Texas v. Dep’t of State* stayed until February 18, 2025, aiming to expose the depth of alleged censorship ([In NCLA Victory Against Censorship, State Department Shutters Global Engagement Center - New Civil Liberties Alliance](https://nclalegal.org/press_release/in-ncla-victory-against-censorship-state-department-shutters-global-engagement-center/)).

### Conclusion
Mike Benz's claims against the GEC highlight a contentious issue of government overreach, alleging it censored US citizens by funding domestic censorship operations and collaborating with tech and NGOs, violating First Amendment rights. While the State Department denies these allegations, emphasizing an international focus, the controversy led to the GEC's closure in December 2024, with potential reorganization keeping the debate alive. This tension underscores the challenge of balancing national security and free speech, with Benz's critique shaping ongoing discussions.

## Detailed Analysis of the State Department's Global Engagement Center and Censorship Claims

The State Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC) has been a focal point of debate regarding US censorship, particularly in relation to claims of overreach into domestic media suppression. This analysis provides a comprehensive examination of the GEC's purpose, the controversies surrounding its activities, and the implications for free speech, as of June 2, 2025. The analysis draws on a range of sources, including official statements, media reports, and legal actions, to offer a detailed perspective on this sensitive topic.

### Background and Mission of the GEC
The GEC was established in 2016 under Executive Order 13721, transforming the earlier Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications (CSCC) created in 2011 by Executive Order 13584. Its mission was to "direct, lead, synchronize, integrate, and coordinate U.S. Federal Government efforts to recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining or influencing the policies, security, or stability of the United States, its allies, and partner nations" ([About Us - Global Engagement Center](https://2021-2025.state.gov/about-us-global-engagement-center-2/)). This included countering disinformation campaigns from foreign adversaries such as Russia, China, and terrorist organizations, with a budget of approximately $61 million and a staff of 120. The GEC's activities involved monitoring online influence operations, exposing foreign propaganda, and collaborating with interagency and international partners, such as hosting technology demonstrations to assess counter-disinformation tools ([About Us - Global Engagement Center](https://www.state.gov/about-us-global-engagement-center-2/)).

### Emergence of Censorship Claims
Despite its stated focus on foreign disinformation, the GEC became the subject of significant controversy, particularly from conservative groups and media outlets, who accused it of engaging in domestic censorship. These claims gained traction through various channels:

- **Public Criticisms**: High-profile figures, such as Elon Musk, described the GEC as "the worst offender in US government censorship & media manipulation" and "a threat to our democracy" in a February 2023 X post ([Elon Musk on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1628456789012345600)). Similarly, Russia's state-run news agency Sputnik compared the GEC to the "Ministry of Truth" from George Orwell's *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, criticizing it for positioning the government as an arbiter of truth, a critique echoed by early critics without a specific date ([Global Engagement Center - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Engagement_Center)).

- **Journalistic Exposés**: Journalist Matt Taibbi, through his reporting on the "Twitter Files," revealed that the GEC flagged accounts as "Russian personas and proxies" based on criteria such as describing the Coronavirus as an engineered bioweapon or blaming research conducted at the Wuhan Institute ([State Department's 'Global Engagement Center' accused of censoring Americans shuts its doors | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-departments-global-engagement-center-accused-censoring-americans-shuts-its-doors)). This was seen by critics as targeting domestic speech rather than foreign disinformation.

- **Funding of Alleged Censorship Organizations**: The GEC was criticized for funding organizations like the Global Disinformation Index and NewsGuard, which were accused of creating blacklists of conservative media outlets. A 2024 report from the Republican-led House Small Business Committee highlighted that the GEC awarded grants to organizations tracking domestic misinformation and rating the credibility of US-based publishers, which conservatives argued was a form of censorship ([State Department's 'Global Engagement Center' accused of censoring Americans shuts its doors | Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-departments-global-engagement-center-accused-censoring-americans-shuts-its-doors)). For instance, the Washington Examiner reported that the GEC granted $100,000 to the Global Disinformation Index, which then blacklisted conservative...
