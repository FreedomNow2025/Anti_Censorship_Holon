The evidence leans toward political and public pressure, including partisan attacks, as driving the board's disbandment on August 24, 2022.

Background
The Disinformation Governance Board (DGB) was an advisory board within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), established on April 27, 2022, to address disinformation threatening national security, particularly from foreign actors like Russia and China. However, it quickly became controversial due to fears it could suppress free speech.

Nina Jankowicz, the board's head, faced intense online attacks and resigned, leading to the board being "paused" on May 18, 2022, just three weeks after its creation. Despite efforts to clarify its role, the controversy persisted, and DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas disbanded the board on August 24, 2022, following a recommendation from the Homeland Security Advisory Council.
Impact
The scandal highlighted tensions between combating disinformation and protecting free speech, reflecting broader debates about government involvement in regulating information. It seems likely that the dissolution was driven by these concerns, though opinions vary on whether the board's intentions were misunderstood.
