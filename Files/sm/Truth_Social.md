 * Amazon and AWS. This is where servers run for Twitter / Gab and the others. This is another gun to the head of social media. Gab is the best illustration. They wouldn't roll out leftist censorship (which they were demanded to do).  Amazon AWS banned them from using servers. Parlor also on 1/10/2021.  Parlor was offline for weeks because AWS was pulled out from under them. Truth Social fled AWS servers Feb 2022.
* Censored by credit card companies. Gab lost Stripe credit card processing in 2018/2019.  Stripe turned OFF credit card processing for Parlor Jan-10-2021. Truth Social didn't use Stripe because they thought this problem would happen to them.
