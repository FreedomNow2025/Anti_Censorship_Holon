# GAB

Related to Censorship or Propoganda or anything potentially interesting in the topic of US Cenorship Industrial Complex.

* Carrot/Stick forcing social media companies under DC dictator control. GAB threatened to be destroyed by EU laws.
* GAB. He had a gun put to his head to have gov censorship go from 0mph to 100 mph. The gun to his head? It was when he was told he would be blocked from having his GAB iPhone app blocked from Apple's app store.  CEO of GAP wouldn't capitulate, so the bullet was fired. He is blocked from Apple and Google/Android app stores.
* PayPal for Credit Card processing by social media companies.  Gab lost paypal in October 2018. Gab in Jan 2021.
* Debanked. GAB CEO talked about being "banned by banks" in 2019. 
* GAB said "no" to this is my understanding. The political left had "Content moderation external services". These were censorship against Republican posts that were too annoying to democrats. At one point, I believe I heard an interview that Parlor was told they must use this or lose being in the Apple AppStore. Parlor capitulated (from my understanding). Their users had to endure this censorship (or whatever the impact was), but it was probably the only way for Parlor to stay in the Apple app store.
* Reddit: They have been 100 mph censoring republicans on there for possibly 20 YEARS. GAB, Parlor and many others exist because Republicans and Libertarians have been gaslight censored, hard censored, banned, etc on Reddit. Sub-reddit by sub-reddit moved to grow Parlor, Gab and about 15 more in the long-tail of reddit/twitter small competitors.
