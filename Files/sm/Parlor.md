# Parlor

Related to Censorship or Propoganda or anything potentially interesting in the topic of US Cenorship Industrial Complex.


* Parlor.  CEO had a gun put to his head to have gov censorship go from 0mph to 100 mph. The gun to his head? It was when he was told he would be blocked from having his Parlor iPhone app blocked from Apple's app store.  This is what BROKE Parlor. He had to "allow" leftist external services "moderate" (censor) the citizen posts in Parlor.  Capitulating allowed Parlor to stay in the app store. Parlor became useless for Republican citizens to communicate. Parlor effect.
* Censored by credit card companies. Gab lost Stripe credit card processing in 2018/2019.  Stripe turned OFF credit card processing for Parlor Jan-10-2021. Truth Social didn't use Stripe because they thought this problem would happen to them.
